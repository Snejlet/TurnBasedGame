Stop the tileHighlights from appearing on collision tiles, and tiles which contain other objects they should not be
    able to pass through (e.g. other actors).
    -poss. loop through mapGrid[] and check value of position in array, and have it not draw if it is position 5.
    -not sure about other actors. Poss. a second for loop within the first, but that seems like it would be really
        inefficient.

Figure out how to get the round number to increment at the start of the first actor's turn in the new round, not
    at the start of the last actor's turn in the previous round (which is the current case).
        -poss. trigger a loop to start when the turnOrderReset value is reset to 0, and have the loop end at the start
        of the next round which causes the round number to increment then.

Add in literally all of the abilities for characters.
    -figure out all of the abilities for characters.

Remove a line of pixels from the top and left side of the tile highlight. Replace with transparent pixels (so it fits
    properly within the tile outlines).

In gameTurn.js on line 72:
    Find a better way of writing the show/hide functionality for actor specific abilities and buttons. Can't think of a
    good way of doing that right now.

In gameAbilities.js on line 28:
    The ability IF statements don't actually check if there is another actor in that tile. Really ought to fix that.

Add in a "Spawn far too many kobolds!" button. V. IMPORTANT
