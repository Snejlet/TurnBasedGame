Stop the tileHighlights from appearing on collision tiles, and tiles which contain other objects they should not be
    able to pass through (e.g. other actors).
    -poss. loop through mapGrid[] and check value of position in array, and have it not draw if it is position 5.
    -not sure about other actors. Poss. a second for loop within the first, but that seems like it would be really
        inefficient.

Figure out how to get the round number to increment at the start of the first actor's turn in the new round, not
    at the start of the last actor's turn in the previous round (which is the current case).
        -poss. trigger a loop to start when the turnOrderReset value is reset to 0, and have the loop end at the start
        of the next round which causes the round number to increment then.

Add in literally all of the abilities for characters.
    -figure out all of the abilities for characters.

In gameTurn.js on line 72:
    Find a better way of writing the show/hide functionality for actor specific abilities and buttons. Can't think of a
    good way of doing that right now.

In gameAbilities:
    Use the for loop that is used for the gameMovement to handle the tile highlights for attacks.

In gameMovement.js:
    Write and algorithm that will work out movement pathing around tiles that do not allow movement.
       -Poss. do this by using a similiar loop to the one used to work out the tile highlights for movement.
            -Pass each adjacent tile to the character into an array. Then pass each adjacent tile to those tiles (if
                movement is allowed for those tiles) into the array. Keep doing this until the maximum movement is
                reached. Make sure to index each value that is passed in.
                -This can then be used to work out the pathing.
                -Google is your friend.
